## Session 2: In the Garden

“Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; there he put the man he had formed.” Genesis 2:8

In the creation account we see that the transcendent came down to the level of the immanent. The garden of Eden is the first place on earth where humans could meet with God and develop their full potential as his image bearers.
