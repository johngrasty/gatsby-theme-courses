## God with Us

Between the covers of the book called The Bible, there lies a wealth of fascinating accounts, such as Noah's ark, David defeating Goliath, Jesus' birth and his resurrection. But all these stories are actually part of a much bigger  story â€“ a story that sweeps from the creation of our cosmos to the climactic recreation of the cosmos. 

Central to this story is the Almighty God, who keeps coming down to be with his people. He comes into the garden, into the wilderness, into the Temple, in the flesh, in the Holy Spirit, and finally, he will dwell among his people in a new creation, in which he will be the centre.
